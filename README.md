# ALL PRACTICALS C++

**1. write a program to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series: ? = 1 − 1 2! + 1 3" − ⋯ 1 ?# the number of terms n is to be taken from the user through the command line. if the command line argument is not found then prompt the user to enter the value of n.***

**10. Create a Triangle class. Add exception handling statements to ensure the following 
conditions: all sides are greater than 0 and sum of any two sides is greater than the third 
side. The class should also have overloaded functions for calculating the area of a right 
angled triangle as well as using Heron's formula to calculate the area of any type of 
triangle.**
